## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to repression indexes in Singapore. I am taking a class on authoritarianism where I am tasked with conducting a study on Lee Kuan Yew's dictatorship and repression styles. There are several ways to measure repression, such as V-Dem, Polity, or via a binary scale. I would like to compile this data and display it visually using R.
